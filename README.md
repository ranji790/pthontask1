Command-Line Calculator
🎯 Objective

Create a command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations.

🛠 Tools Used

Language: Python

Editor: VS Code / Any text editor

Execution: Terminal / Command Prompt

📜 Description

This project is a simple command-line calculator built in Python.
It allows users to perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division operations interactively.

The calculator runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

⚙️ Features

✅ Supports +, -, *, / operations
✅ Handles invalid inputs gracefully
✅ Displays clear and structured output
✅ Runs continuously until the user exits

💻 How to Run

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the project folder:

cd "C:\Users\rijit\OneDrive\Desktop\python task 1"


Run the script:

python calculator.py


Follow the on-screen menu to perform calculations.

📂 Project Structure

🧩 Code Overview

The program defines four main functions:

add(a, b) — returns the sum of two numbers

subtract(a, b) — returns the difference

multiply(a, b) — returns the product

divide(a, b) — returns the quotient or an error if dividing by zero

The main() function handles:

User input

Menu display

Operation selection

Continuous execution until exit

🧠 Outcome

A well-structured, interactive Python calculator that demonstrates:

Use of functions

Input handling

Loop control

Basic arithmetic logic
